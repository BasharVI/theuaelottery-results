## What this is (and isn‚Äôt)

- ‚úÖ A simple **Node.js script** you can run locally or schedule with **cron/GitHub Actions**.  
- ‚úÖ Pulls results via **public JSON endpoints** you supply (for example, captured from your browser‚Äôs Network tab).  
- ‚úÖ Posts a cleanly formatted message to your **Telegram channel** using your own bot.  
- ‚úÖ Logs each draw to **separate Excel files** (e.g. `pick3.xlsx`, `pick4.xlsx`, and future games like `luckyday.xlsx`), ensuring no duplicate rows based on `Date + Game`.  
- ‚ùå Not an official product and **not** a public API mirror or bulk re-distributor.  
- ‚ùå No scraping or browser automation required if stable public endpoints are available.
